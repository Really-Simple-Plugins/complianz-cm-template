This is the Github repository for the freely available Google Tag Manager Template for Complianz' Consent Mode initialization. You can find it directly available in the Community Gallery on TagManager.com, or download the template.tpl and import to your container.

## How can I change it?

You're able to change the template directly when imported. If you want to see it in the default template, please do a pull request and explain what changed.

## How to use this template?

There are 3 prerequisites to be able to use this template.
